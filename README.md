# UPDATE: This repository is no longer available due to copyright/Intellectual Propery disputes

Unfortunately, due to external pressures I am forced to discontinue this project and remove all scripts due to copyright/IP issues with external parties.  I'm sad to see the removal of the scripts but ultimately, its the best decision to avoid further issues.  Thank you to everyone who supported and found use for these scripts.  I hope that anyone who used these scripts found them helpful and beneficial to automating AV tasks.

Thank you everyone for the support.

Here's to future projects,
